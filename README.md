wordhash provides human-readable representations of digests.  
A clone of Zachary Voase's
[humanhash](https://github.com/zacharyvoase/humanhash).

## Example

```ruby
require 'word_hash'

digest = '7528880a986c40e78c38115e640da2a1'
# => "7528880a986c40e78c38115e640da2a1"

WordHash.new.humanize digest
# => "three-georgia-xray-jig"
WordHash.new.humanize digest, 6
# => "high-mango-white-oregon-purple-charlie"

WordHash.new.uuid
# => ["04edcd5325a34dc191d4880676ebae61", "lemon-artist-snake-gee"]
```

## Caveats

Don't store the humanhash output, as its statistical uniqueness is only around
1 in 4.3 billion. Its intended use is as a human-readable (and, most
importantly, memorable) representation of a longer digest, unique enough for
display in a user interface, where a user may need to remember or verbally
communicate the identity of a hash, without having to remember a 40-character
hexadecimal sequence. Nevertheless, you should keep original digests around,
then pass them through humanize() only as you're displaying them.

## How It Works

The procedure for generating a humanhash involves compressing the input to a
fixed length (default: 4 bytes), then mapping each of these bytes to a word in
a pre-defined wordlist (a default wordlist is supplied with the library). This
algorithm is consistent, so the same input, given the same wordlist, will
always give the same output. You can also use your own wordlist, and specify a
different number of words for output.
